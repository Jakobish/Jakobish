# Hi, I'm Kobi Shahar 

## My Focus Today: AI as a Force Multiplier
In recent years, I’ve shifted my focus toward **AI Systems Architecture**. I don't just "use" LLMs; I build integrated reasoning pipelines using **Agentic RAG frameworks** and **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** to connect knowledge and automation in real-time.
*“I don’t just build systems — I build systems that build smarter people.”*
## 🛠 What I'm working on
* **Agentic Workflows & MCP:** Developing custom servers for the **Model Context Protocol** to empower LLMs with real-world design and data capabilities.
* **Enterprise RAG Frameworks:** Designing high-efficiency AI pipelines that reduce inference costs and improve accuracy.
* **Modern SaaS Architectures:** Crafting high-performance, scalable platforms using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Supabase**.
* **Legacy Modernization:** Optimizing complex infrastructure.
## Technical Stack
* **AI/Agentic:** MCP, LangGraph, RAG, OpenAI SDK, LangChain, Vector Databases (Pinecone/pgvector).
* **Engineering:** TypeScript, Next.js, Node.js, Python, .NET.
* **Backend & Systems:** PostgreSQL, Supabase, Docker, Hyper-V, PowerShell Automation.
* **Security & Forensics:** PDF Internals, OCR Pipelines, QPDF, Malware Detection.
