## About Me
Hi, I’m **Kobi Shahar** — a software and electrical engineer, entrepreneur, and lifelong builder.  
For over two decades I’ve been designing systems that make technology simpler, faster, and smarter.  

I started by building **LiveDNS**, one of Israel’s first automated hosting platforms, long before “DevOps” was a word.  
Later I founded **VirtualBox Technologies**, helping enterprises modernize infrastructure, optimize costs, and bring automation where it matters most.  

In recent years, my focus shifted toward **AI systems architecture** — integrating **LLMs, agentic RAG frameworks, and MCP-based reasoning pipelines** that connect knowledge and automation in real time.  
I see AI not as a replacement for people, but as a **force multiplier** — making talented teams even better.

I thrive where technology meets people: mentoring, simplifying, and creating elegant solutions that last.  
Not chasing hype — just building things that actually work.

When I’m not coding or optimizing workflows, you’ll find me **designing surfboards, sketching, or exploring AI-driven creativity tools.**  
Always learning. Always improving.
