# Hi, I'm Kobi Shahar 👋
## Principal AI Architect | Enterprise Modernization Expert | Lifelong Builder
I am a software and electrical engineer with over 20 years of experience in designing systems that make technology simpler, faster, and smarter. From building one of Israel’s first automated hosting platforms (**LiveDNS**) to founding **VirtualBox Technologies**, I specialize in the **"0-to-1"** phase—bridging the gap between complex infrastructure and elegant, automated solutions.
## 🧠 My Focus Today: AI as a Force Multiplier
In recent years, I’ve shifted my focus toward **AI Systems Architecture**. I don't just "use" LLMs; I build integrated reasoning pipelines using **Agentic RAG frameworks** and **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** to connect knowledge and automation in real-time.
*“I don’t just build systems — I build systems that build smarter people.”*
## 🛠 What I'm working on
* **Agentic Workflows & MCP:** Developing custom servers for the **Model Context Protocol** to empower LLMs with real-world design and data capabilities.
* **Enterprise RAG Frameworks:** Designing high-efficiency AI pipelines that reduce inference costs and improve accuracy.
* **Modern SaaS Architectures:** Crafting high-performance, scalable platforms using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Supabase**.
* **Legacy Modernization:** Optimizing complex infrastructure (Ask me how I reduced API latency from 20s to 0.5s at Silverbyte).
## 🚀 Technical Stack
* **AI/Agentic:** MCP, LangGraph, RAG, OpenAI SDK, LangChain, Vector Databases (Pinecone/pgvector).
* **Engineering:** TypeScript, Next.js, Node.js, Python, .NET, Go.
* **Backend & Systems:** PostgreSQL, Supabase, Docker, Hyper-V, PowerShell Automation.
* **Security & Forensics:** PDF Internals, OCR Pipelines, QPDF, Malware Detection.
## 📊 Featured Open Source Work
* **++[framer-mcp-server](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/Jakobish/framer-mcp-server)++** — Empowering AI agents to interact with Framer designs via MCP.
* **++[mcp-framer-server](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/Jakobish/mcp-framer-server)++** — Advanced integration for design-to-code agentic workflows.
## 🎨 Beyond the Code
When I’m not architecting AI systems, I’m likely designing surfboards, sketching, or exploring the intersection of AI and creativity.
