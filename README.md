# Hi, I'm Kobi 👋  

I’ve been building software, systems, and businesses for over two decades — from the low-level world of servers, protocols, and databases, to modern AI-driven workflows and forensic tools.  

### 🚀 What I’ve Built
- **LiveDNS** – One of the first web hosting and domain registrars in Israel.  
- **LiveShop** – A pioneering SaaS e-commerce platform (before “SaaS” was a buzzword).  
- **Custom automation systems** – From cryptographic workflows (PGP-signed XML for domain registration) to billing engines and API integrations.  
- **Digital Forensics expertise** – Especially around PDF internals, object recovery, and forensic automation.  

### 🔎 What I Focus On
- **Integration & Automation** – Turning complexity into streamlined systems.  
- **Databases & Infrastructure** – SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and distributed architectures.  
- **AI & Prompt Engineering** – RAG pipelines, vector search, context engineering, and agent-based systems.  
- **Forensics & Security** – Deep analysis of formats (like PDF) and resilient system design.  

### 🎯 My Approach
I thrive on solving problems that look impossible at first.  
I enjoy bridging the gap between **deep technical layers** (protocols, servers, forensic data) and **big-picture business impact** (scalable products, SaaS platforms, resilient architectures).  

### 📌 Beyond Code
- Mentor, team builder, and entrepreneur.  
- Comfortable leading both hands-on technical work and high-level solution architecture.  
- Passionate about sharing knowledge, improving workflows, and pushing boundaries.
